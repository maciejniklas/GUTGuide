## General info
This project is a software part of my master thesis titled "Analysis of the possibility of using Google Maps Platform Gaming Services to generate a realistic terrain model in real-time". The main goal is to get terrain as similar to reality as it is possible. All this with buildings 3D model procedural generation.

This is an application that helps get familiar with Gdańsk University of Technology campus. If you get lost this is the best tool that you could have on your phone. It enables you to find every building that you want and even find the best path to each building.
